      "title": "Princess Haya: Dubai ruler and wife begin London court battle",
      "content": "The ruler of Dubai, one of the most high-profile leaders in the Middle East, and his estranged wife are beginning a court battle in London over the welfare of their children.\n\nSheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum's wife, Princess Haya Bint al-Hussein, is the third female member of his court to run away from the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThis month she was reported to be in hiding in London in fear for her life.\n\nThe UK court case centres around their children, with whom she fled.\n\nPrincess Haya, who was born in Jordan and educated at private schools in Britain, is an Olympic equestrian and the half-sister of the current Jordanian ruler, King Abdullah II.\n\nShe married Sheikh Mohammed in 2004, becoming his sixth and \"junior\" wife. The 70-year-old sheikh, who is the billionaire owner of Godolphin horse racing stables, reportedly has 23 children by different wives.\n\nWho is Princess Haya?\nDubai ruler's wife 'in fear for her life'\n\nMedia captionDubai: It's flash, it's brash, it's successful – but what's going on beneath the surface?\nPrincess Haya initially fled to Germany to try and seek asylum there, but it emerged this month that she was living in central London - specifically, in an £85m ($107m) town house in Kensington Palace Gardens.\n\nIt's believed that Princess Haya will want to stay in the UK. However, if her husband demands her return to Dubai, this could cause a diplomatic headache for Britain - which has close ties to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nAfter she fled, Sheikh Mohammed wrote an angry poem accusing an unnamed woman of betrayal and treachery, and posted it on his Instagram page.\n\nWhy is Princess Haya said to have run away?\nSources close to the princess said earlier this month that she had recently discovered disturbing facts about the mysterious return to Dubai last year of Sheikha Latifa, one of Sheikh Mohammed's daughters.\n\nSheikha Latifa had escaped the UAE by sea with the help of a Frenchman, but was intercepted by armed men off the coast of India. She was then returned to Dubai.\n\n\nMedia captionWhat happened to Sheikha Latifa?\nAt the time, Princess Haya defended Dubai's reputation over the incident, claiming that Shiekha Latifa had been \"vulnerable to exploitation\" and was \"now safe in Dubai\". Human rights advocates said she was abducted against her will.\n\nImages of 'missing' Dubai princess released\nHowever later, sources alleged that Princess Haya had become aware of new information related to the case, and as a result came under increasing pressure from her husband's extended family."

      "title": "Democratic debates: Five things to look out for",
      "content": "It's time for Round Two in the Democratic primary debates.\n\nOr, to be more precise, it's round 2a and 2b, since once again the sprawling Democratic field will be divided into two groups of 10, each with two hours on prime-time television to scuffle and struggle and jostle and whatever other verbs it takes to separate themselves from the pack.\n\nAlthough the groupings have been shuffled, Tuesday and Wednesday night in Detroit will feature almost entirely the same cast of characters as in June. The one change is that California Representative Eric Swalwell has passed the torch, so to speak, to Montana Governor Steve Bullock.\n\nSwalwell, in fact, dropped out of the race entirely, instead announcing he would run for re-election to the House of Representatives.\n\nHis presence will be missed. By someone. Probably.\n\nThere are plenty of things to watch for among the candidates who did make the cut, however. Here are a few.\n\nBiden in the crosshairs again?\nThe highlight of the first round of debates was the exchange between former Vice-President Joe Biden and California Senator Kamala Harris over the former's record of opposing school desegregation via mandatory bussing back in the 1970s.\n\n\"Exchange\" may be putting it nicely. It was a one-sided affair, as Biden appeared caught off guard by Harris' criticism, which culminated with her noting that she was a direct beneficiary of the kind of efforts then-Senator Biden opposed.\n\nThe encounter crystallised the consensus that the former vice-president had an uneven debate performance and helped give Harris a noticeable boost in the polls (accompanied by a Biden dip).\n\nBiden has steadied himself since then, but there's blood in the water. He and Harris once again share the stage in the Wednesday night debate, and Biden has said he'll be ready this time.\n\n\nMedia captionHarris and Biden clash over his race record\nHe better be. The shots, however, may not from Harris, who has probably squeezed all the benefit she can from tussles with Biden. Others on the stage - particularly Senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand - may have taken note of Harris's success and seek to replicate it.\n\nBooker has already taken aim at Biden's sponsorship of a harsh anti-crime bill in the 1990s, calling him an \"architect of mass incarceration\".\n\nRight now a plurality of Democratic voters appear to think Biden is the candidate best able to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump in 2020. He'll have to prove he can handle his primary opponents first, however. He didn't do that in the first debate June. He'll have another opportunity on Wednesday.\n\nFalter again, and the whispers that he may not be the man for the job will grow louder\n\nSanders vs. Warren at last\nOne of the big line-up disappointments from the last round of debates was that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders - the two candidates competing the hardest for the hearts and minds of progressive Democrats - appeared on different nights.\n\nOn Tuesday the anticipated face-off will finally happen.\n\nThe ingredients are there for sparks to fly. After a slow start, Warren has been steadily building support and surpassed Sanders both in second-quarter fund-raising and in some of the early-state polls.\n\n\nMedia captionElizabeth Warren: \"Economy is good for a thin slice of America\"\nWarren represents a serious and growing threat to the Vermont senator's presidential hopes. It's still not clear, however, that he knows how to address it.\n\nIt would benefit the Vermont senator to take his fellow New Englander down a notch, but he has provoked criticism every time he, or a member of his campaign, try to do it.\n\nWho will take on Trump in 2020?\nThe key issues for 2020 Democrats\nBiden fundraising eclipsed by junior 2020 Democrat\nThere are definitely contrasts to be drawn. Sanders, unlike the former Republican Warren, has been a long-time advocate of progressive causes. Warren's \"I have a plan\" campaign strategy tends to advocate changing the system from within, while Sanders speaks of a people-driven political \"revolution\".\n\nThe challenge for Sanders will be trying to find a way to highlight those contrasts without being perceived as attacking another star of the progressive moment.\n\nMeanwhile, Warren won't want to rock a campaign boat that has been picking up steam. If this all ends in hugs and smiles, that's just fine with her.\n\nBeto vs Buttigieg\nLast summer, Beto O'Rourke was a political sensation.\n\nHis campaign to unseat Ted Cruz from his Senate seat in solidly conservative Texas made national headlines. He was drawing huge crowds and fundraising like a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate, not a congressional back-bencher.\n\nThe 46-year-old former punk rocker was seen as the face of a new generation of politicians, with a youthful energy and charisma that stood in stark contrast to the elderly leaders of both political parities.\n\nImage copyrightDREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES\nImage caption\nPete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders at the first Democratic debate\nFast forward a year, and the bloom is off O'Rourke's rose. He's sagging in the polls, and the money isn't flowing like it used to. Instead, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is now the guy getting the glowing press. He led the Democratic pack in second-quarter fund-raising and is the one talked about as a standard-bearer for a new political generation.\n\nFor the first time on Tuesday night, the two will share a debate stage. In last month's debate, O'Rourke underwhelmed, appearing timid and uncertain while getting pushed around by Julian Castro on what should be one of his strengths, immigration policy.\n\nThis next debate could give the Texan a chance to regain some of his lost lustre - perhaps at Buttigieg's expense.\n\nHe's going to have to do something to shake things up, because the path he's currently on ends next to Eric Swalwell.\n\nSecond night so white\nThe Democrats this campaign have the most diverse major-party presidential primary field in American history. You wouldn't be able to tell by looking at the stage on Tuesday night's debate, however.\n\nCNN responded to criticism about the opaque way NBC announced the field for its two June debates - which included most of the top-tier candidates on one night - by having a televised drawing event akin to a World Cup group-selection show. The end result, however, left much to be desired.\n\n\nMedia captionDemocrats clash over policy, history and food\nThe 10-person field on Tuesday night's debate has none of the five minority candidates. The party's first foot forward this time around will reflect little of the range of ethnicities that make up the heart of the modern Democratic Party. (And Warren's presence prompted more than a few jokes from conservatives about her claimed American Indian heritage.)\n\nDonald Trump's recent criticisms of minority Democrats in Congress, including Ilhan Omar and Baltimore Congressman Elijah Cummings, has rekindled a debate about race - and racism - in American society. The topic will certainly come up in the first debate. Will anyone on the stage be able to convincingly address it?\n\nLast chance saloon\nIt may not be hard to detect a whiff of desperation in the air this week. When the next official primary debate rolls around in mid-September, only 10 candidates will make the cut. In other words, at least half the men and women on the stage in Detroit are going to be left watching from the sidelines - if they're still in the race at all.\n\nThe mark to qualify for the Houston debate doubles - to at least 2% in an average of polls and more than 130,000 unique donors. So far, the only candidates to clear both hurdles are Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, O'Rourke, Sanders and Warren.\n\nFor the rest of the candidates, there's work to be done. This could be the final opportunity to make their case in front of a national audience; their last chance to bottle the fabled political lightning and transform from also-ran to at least a maybe-can-run.\n\nYou know what desperate times call for."

      "content": "Guardian writers’ predicted position: 19th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)\n\nLast season’s position: 17th\n\nOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 1,500-1\n\nWhen the royal blue “El Capitan” mural on the side of Church Street, in the heart of Brighton’s North Laine, was painted over before the final game of last season it signalled the beginning of the end of an era. In the weeks after the graffiti, which depicted Bruno as a king, the Spaniard retired with his status as a cult hero intact and the manager Chris Hughton was sacked and replaced by Graham Potter. Since then Anthony Knockaert, a catalyst in the team’s promotion two years ago, has departed on loan. But there is calm at Brighton, a feeling that such change represents evolution rather than revolution.\n\nWhether it was second-season syndrome, the way things had gone stale, the sense of predictability that seeped through a once-exciting team – or a bit of everything – Brighton felt they needed to freshen things up after nose-diving towards a Championship return after three wins from Hughton’s final 23 league matches. In Potter, who worked miracles at the Swedish club Östersund and, in many ways, at a financially hamstrung Swansea too, they have appointed one of the most exciting English coaches. “The job that was done here was a really good job,” Potter said. “We are now in a different phase, a different stage and everyone has been really supportive to that. But every coach, no matter who they are and what their beliefs are, would want to improve on the previous year. Now the task is to see if we can.”\n\nAs for Bruno, who turns 39 in October, the former Valencia defender made 14 starts in his seventh and final campaign in Sussex and has assumed the role of senior development coach, which will see him act as a kind of middleman between the first team and staff, and as a mentor to the under-23s and loan players. Lewis Dunk, who is set to take the captaincy full time, has been persistently linked with a move from his hometown club this summer but Potter insists Dunk has been the consummate professional. “He has been top – he has been brilliant,” Potter said. “His attitude has been fantastic, he was the captain last year, he has taken that responsibility on and has grown as a person as a result of that and he has been nothing but exemplary in his work.”"

      "content": "The former world No 1, Andy Murray, is considering returning to singles action at Cincinnati next month, saying he is “closer than he thought” to being ready.\n\nThe 32-year-old has not played singles since losing in the first round of the Australian Open in January to Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut, after which he underwent hip resurfacing surgery in a bid to salvage his career.\n\nHe returned to doubles action at Queen’s Club this year, winning the title with Spain’s Feliciano López, and also played men’s doubles with Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert and mixed with Serena Williams at Wimbledon.\n\nThe three-time grand slam champion had previously said it was extremely unlikely he would be ready to play singles at the US Open but now believes a return on the Cincinnati hardcourts in two weeks’ time is possible.\n\n“I’m closer than I thought,” Murray said at the Citi Open in Washington where he is playing doubles with his brother Jamie. “Best case scenario probably would be Cincinnati. And then if I wasn’t able to play in Cincinnati, there’s a good chance I would probably wait until after New York, because I wouldn’t want my first tournament, either, to be playing best-of-five sets.“\n\nMurray said he is practising singles in Washington and is also lined up to play doubles at the Rogers Cup next week in Toronto with López. “In terms of moving and feeling and waking up the next day, I’m feeling good,” Murray said. “I’m quite close but there’s stuff that would need to get better.\n\n“I could [play singles] but to get where I would want to be I’d have to get back in the gym and get my cardio better.”"

      "title": "Iron Age Celtic Woman Wearing Fancy Clothes Buried in This 'Tree Coffin' in Switzerland",
      "content": "During the late Iron Age, Celts laid one of their own to rest in a tree coffin, but not before they dressed her to the nines; she wore a fine woolen dress and shawl, a sheepskin coat and a beautiful necklace strung with glass and amber beads, according to the Office for Urban Development in Zurich.\n\nAfter studying the 2,200-year-old burial, archaeologists learned that the woman was about 40 years old when she died and had probably performed little physical labor during her lifetime. Moreover, an analysis of her teeth suggested this woman liked to eat starchy or sweetened foods.\n\nEven her coffin was remarkable; the woman was buried in a hollowed-out tree trunk, which still had bark on its exterior. [In Photos: Ancient Tomb of a Celtic Prince Uncovered]\n\nThe woman's remains were originally found in March 2017, during a construction project at the Kern school complex in Aussersihl, a district in Zurich. Since then, an interdisciplinary examination by the Zurich archaeology department has illustrated much about this woman's life in 200 B.C. For instance, an isotope analysis of the woman's bones showed that she was a local who grew up in Zurich, likely in Limmat Valley. (An isotope is an element with a different number of neutrons than usual.)\n\nThe archaeologists were especially intrigued by the clasp on the woman's necklace. Both ends of the necklace had a garment clip known as a brooch that allowed her to wear the string of blue and yellow glass and amber beads, they said in a statement (translated from German with Google Translate.)\n\nThe woman also wore bronze bracelets and a delicate bronze belt chain with pendants hanging from it. Several iron clasps held her clothes together.\n\nThe woman's remains were found buried about 260 feet (80 meters) from the grave of a Celtic man found in 1903 when the school's gym was being built, the Office for Urban Development reported. That man had been buried with a sword, shield and lance.\n\nBecause these two individuals were buried in the same decade, it's possible they knew each other, the archaeologists said.\n\nThough people often think of the Celts as hailing from the United Kingdom, they actually lived in continental Europe, as far east as modern-day Turkey, Live Science previously reported.\n\n25 Cultures That Practiced Human Sacrifice\nIn Photos: Boneyard of Iron Age Warriors\nPhotos: Gold, Amber and Bronze Treasures Found in Iron Age Grave"

      "content": "Divers Find Temples and Treasures in Sunken Ancient Egyptian City\nDivers discovered the remains of a temple in the now-underwater ancient Egyptian city of Heracleion.\nCredit: Christoph Gerigk/Hilti Foundation/Egypt Ministry of Antiquities\nDivers swimming through Heracleion, an ancient Egyptian city that's now under water, have discovered a trove of artifacts, including the remains of a temple, gold jewelry, coins and the missing piece of a ceremonial boat, according to Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities.\n\nHeracleion — named after the legendary Hercules, who ancient people believed actually visited the city — was a bustling metropolis in its day. When it was built in about the eighth century B.C., it sat on the edge of the Nile River, next to the Mediterranean Sea. Cleopatra was even crowned in one of its temples. Then, about 1,500 years ago, it flooded, and now sits under about 150 feet (45 meters) of water.\n\nEver since archaeologists discovered it in 2000, Heracleion (also known as Thonis) has slowly revealed its ancient secrets. During the latest two-month excavation, archaeologists were delighted to find the remains of a large temple, including its stone columns, and the crumbling remnants of a small Greek temple, which was buried under 3 feet (1 m) of sediment on the seafloor, the ministry reported. [Photos: Teen's Skeleton Buried Next to Pyramid in Egypt]\n\nThe excavation team of Egyptian and European archaeologists was led by Franck Goddio, the underwater archaeologist who discovered Heracleion 19 years ago. Together, the team used a scanning tool that transmits images of artifacts resting on the seafloor and those buried beneath it.\n\nA gold earring found at the underwater site.\nA gold earring found at the underwater site.\nCredit: Christoph Gerigk/Hilti Foundation/Egypt Ministry of Antiquities\nThe scanning tool revealed part of a boat. During past excavations, archaeologists had found 75 boats, although not all of them were complete. This new finding was the missing part of boat 61, which was likely used for ceremonial purposes, the Ministry of Antiquities said in a statement.\n\nIt wasn't a small boat, either. When the archaeologists pieced boat 61 together, it measured 43 feet long and 16 feet across (13 m by 5 m). \n\nThe ship held tiny treasures — coins of bronze and gold, as well as jewelry. The bronze coins uncovered at Heracleion date to the time of King Ptolemy II, who ruled from 283 to 246 B.C. The team also discovered pottery dating to the third and fourth centuries B.C., the ministry noted.\n\nOne of the coins found during the underwater excavation.\nOne of the coins found during the underwater excavation.\nCredit: Christoph Gerigk/Hilti Foundation/Egypt Ministry of Antiquities\nThe team also looked at the underwater site of Canopus, which, like Heracleion, is located in the Gulf of Abu Qir, Alexandria. At Canopus, the archaeologists found an ancient building complex that extended the city's footprint southward about 0.6 miles (1 kilometer), the ministry said.\n\nCanopus also held other treasures; the archaeologists found an ancient port, coins from the Ptolemaic and Byzantine periods, and rings and earrings from Ptolemaic times. All of these artifacts indicate that Canopus was a busy city from the fourth century B.C. to the Islamic era."
